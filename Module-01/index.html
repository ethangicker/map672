    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    Growing up in the rural mountain west I was taught to memorize my home’s township, rang, and quarter section to report wildfires.  My family kept a folded 15-minute topo map by the phone to see where smoke columns across the canyon were.  In the summer I studied nautical charts and tide books to plan kayak trips around the Puget Sound in Western Washington.  As an adult I’ve taught others to pull the necessary information out of a 7.5 minute quad.  I use a paper map every day at work.  It’s only recently that I got a smartphone, electricity and internet are not a given where I live.  One can see where this is going, I am a cartographer through and through.  Digital maps frustrate me, their dependency on batteries and connectivity leave me vulnerable and uncertain.  That being said I am enticed by their interactivity and specificity. I am a cartographer but I hear the Svengali call of the coder.

My mapping priorities are simple, be transparent, be helpful and build graceful maps.  Transparency starts with communication of my biases, gender, race and education among others.  My point of view is tied to my life experiences and my viewers should know these.  If a map doesn’t help you see something new or understand something old what’s the point?  Maps should look good, just like we speak politely with good manners maps should also communicate with good manners.

“Maps help us understand the world.  But maps also produce the world as we know it.”
The concept of a map is not recognized through out the world’s cultures.  The “us” is particularly important here.  I lived in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the upper Congo basin among forest people.  The guys I lived with did not know what maps were.  When I showed them maps they just couldn’t wrap their heads around the maps.  There is no topography in the area the only remarkable natural features are braided rivers and oxbow ponds.  There are no roads or infrastructure beyond trails that shift around based on the season.  The Congolese men I worked with navigated exclusively with verbal directions.  To get directions 20k to the next village could take 30 minutes or more.  I would draw sketches based on these directions; the Congolese guys could just remember the whole thing. Incredible. 
To them, maps do not help understand their world.
